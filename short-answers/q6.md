# Question

What does `element.append()` do? What is an advantage it has over `element.appendChild()`?

# Answer

`element.append()` will add all arguments as last children to the given `element`. The order in which last children are added goed from first argument to last argument. The advantage that `element.append()` has over `element.appendChild()` is that `element.append()` is capable of accepting several arguments and appending them all. On the other hand, `element.appendChild()` is only capable of appending one last child at a time.
