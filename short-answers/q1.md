# Question

What is the primary difference between an HTTP GET request and an HTTP Post request?

# Answer

The primary difference between an `HTTP GET` request and an `HTTP POST` request is that `GET` reads data from the server, while `POST` will create data on the server. When using the `fetch()` function to send a `GET` request, you only need to pass in the appropriate url. On the other hand, when sending a `POST` request via the `fetch()` function, you must pass an option object along with the appropriate url so that the data can be created at the proper place.
