# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer

Semantic elements will "tell you" about the purpose they serve. They may even format things a certain way for you. For example, `input` tags are specifically for user input and depending on the type will format a certain way. `nav` tags do not format everything for you, but they let developers know that the html inside is for a 'nav'igation bar. `h2` tags turns the text inside into Heading 2 text on your page.

Contrastingly non-semantic elements such as `div` or `span` do not denote a purpose for their usage just by using them
