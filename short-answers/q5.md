# Question

What is the danger behind inserting user entered information _directly_ into the DOM unescaped?

# Answer

This is dangerous because this opens your code up to Cross-site Scripting. For example, this means that when you edit your html using the `.innterHTML` property, users can enter scripts with `script` tags. This can disrupt your code and allow the user to do things that you did not intend.
