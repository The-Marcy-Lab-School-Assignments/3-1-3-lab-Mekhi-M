# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer

1. This allows us to link one js file that imports functions and other code from another file. The one file can be a main hub from which every thing is run.

2. This allows for the import of file types other than .js files into that same js file. Some other important file types to link: .css files, .json files
