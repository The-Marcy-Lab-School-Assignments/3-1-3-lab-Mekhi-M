# Question

What is the "Request/Response Cycle?"

# Answer

It is the pattern of communication between a client and a server. The server is always looking for a request, but it cannot send anything unless it receives a request. Clients are the ones that send the request to the server. After the client sends the request, the server will process that request and send a response back to the client.
